activity = 6 activity names (character) <br>
type = feature type, i.e. "tBodyAcc", "fBodyGyro", etc. (character) <br>
measure = standard measure, i.e. mean or standard deviation (character) <br>
value = the observations associated with the former variables (numeric) <br>

group_n = the number of each subgroup. provided for reference.
