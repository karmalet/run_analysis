the tidy data set created in step 5

5 variables = {subject, activity, type, measure, value, average, group_n"

subject: the subject who performed the activity for each window sample (1-30 numeric)
activity = 6 activity names (character)
type = feature type, i.e. "tBodyAcc", "fBodyGyro", etc. (character)
measure = standard measure, i.e. mean or standard deviation (character)
value = the observations associated with the former variables (numeric)
average = the average of values in each group. grouping was based on 4 factors(subject, activity, type, measure)
group_n = the number of each subgroup. provided for reference.
